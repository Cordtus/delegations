# -Stakeflow- Delegation Program Application

## Description

Stakeflow is a team of professional digital engineers and programmers with more than seven-year experience in crypto. We are currently validating [13 blockchains](https://validator.stakeflow.io/) and developing an original multi-functional [block explorer](https://stakeflow.io/). On top of that, our team provides various [public goods](https://github.com/stakeflow/public-goods) for the crypto community, such as endpoints and others.
In addition, we aim to attract newcomers to the crypto field and raise the awareness of the current community members. To achieve this goal we create original educational content on our [social networks](https://blog.stakeflow.io/).
