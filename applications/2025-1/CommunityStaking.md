# -Validator Name- Delegation Program Application

## Description

We have been a validator since the very early stages of Cosmos. We have always had a big focus on being a validator that try to bridge the gap between project and project teams that focus on technical innovation and the average user. We focus on adding mostly non-technical value to a project with the average user in mind.
